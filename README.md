# underpaid-librarian-game

###### Description
This is a game I developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript for Project 1 of Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp.

###### Instructions
You must help this underpaid librarian collect 5 rare books from the Restricted Section of the Library.
But there's a catch - The Dusties roam those halls. Watch out for their sharp bite!
Use the Up and Down Arrows to move the librarian.
You win the game if you catch 5 books before your lives run out!
For an added immersion bonus, click the Play Music button!
